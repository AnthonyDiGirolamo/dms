Verified Bugs
=============

DOCUMENTS:
----------

  * [FIXED] Uploading a file with no extension works, downloading it doesn't

  * [FIXED] Document downloads are not checked for ownership 
	(the full path is NOT shown)

  * [FIXED] Only authors should be able to delete their own documents

SHARING:
--------

  * [FIXED] Document Sharing You can share a document with an admin, which
    then shows you the admin’s email address.

  * [FIXED] can share with pending/suspended/deleted users

  * [FIXED] Can share with yourself

  * [FIXED] NEW (Found by me) If an employee shares a doc with a
	manager/corp in their department the share privileges overwrite the
	manager ones.

  * [FIXED] Someone checkouts a shared document, the author removes the
	share but the document remains checked out.

SESSIONS:
---------

  * Failed login attempts are not logged (neither are regular login
    attempts), and don't lock the account.

  * User is logged in, Admin deletes the user,User can still use the site
    until logged out

  * Deleting a user should "Un-checkout" their documents?

  * [FIXED] Username is not case sensitive

Could not be reproduced
=======================

  * hitting the back button allows you to continue to use a logged out
    session

  * creating 2 documents with the same name, deleting one deletes both

  * Sorting causes errors in IE (screenshots looked like IE6)
    (works in IE 7 and 8)

  * Cannot share checkout or modify privileges to an employee.
    Steps to re-create: 1. Create a Manager and an Employee.  2. Have the
    Manager upload documents.  3. Have the Manger share the document with
    an Employee or another user.  Failure: The manager should be able to
    give edit and checkout privileges to the other users.  Notes: I was
    able to share privileges previously. So this failure may take multiple
    iterations. I am not exactly sure of a root cause.

  * Bug 9.3 – Sharing document fails after sharing with two other users.
    Steps to re-create 1. Share a document with two users.  2. Share the
    same document with a third user.  Failure: The system refuses to share
    the document indicating the third user is already in the share list.
    Notes: All three users are from different departments. I checked the
    document out after the second sharing, but I don't know if that had an
    effect.

	TONY: Something is wrong, I sometimes get the "You are already sharing
	this document with that user." message. But there is no extra entry in
	the database. Now, I can't reproduce the error.

  * The share listing is not showing the shared files. When user1 shares a
    document with user2, the system does not show the shares file under
    user2’s shared file list. -  No sharing access privilege: when user1
    wants to share a document with other users, there is any access
    privilege such as read, update, and check in/out for user1 to give
    access to other user.

	TONY: Not sure I understand what's wrong here.

  * Inconsistent file uploading Sometimes text files are uploaded without
    any error. Sometimes uploading gives an error

  * When uploading a document, if a file of size more than 100 MB is used,
    than it uploads the file on the server, and then shows an error. This
    can harmful as the server space might get used up easily, if the
    attacker keeps on uploading large files.

	TONY: This is true, but the nginx server upload limit was set to stop
	cliend uploads over 50mb. The DMS app rejects anything larger than 20.

Needs to be verified
====================

  * Cross-Site Request Forgery (automated logout) – Visiting a webpage with
    a malicious img while logged in will automatically log you out from
    your authenticated session. Example HTML code:

    <img src=" https://129.219.33.6/logout"/>

    Reproduction Steps: Log in to the site, Open a page in another tab with
    the malicious HTML above, You are logged out from the site

More Comments
=============

  * Uploading files: you can change the filetype/filename if you wish on
    updates

	TONY: It's likely that documents may undergo format changes. For
	example, one office program format to another. This was done on
	purpose.

  * Even though the admin approves user1, I was not able to sign in because
    the state was still showing “pending” in the users list. I tried giving
    a fake email id and I didn’t get anything as expected. I also tried a
    valid email add and I still didn’t get the activation code for a long
    time. 

  * After a denied access, user is not logged out.

  * No strong password rules

  * Database ID's are shown all over the site

  * Admin has to choose a department?

    TONY: No, this was a confusing part of the UI, requests as
	administrators ignore the department, it doesn't get added.

  * Accessibility was poor.  Had to wait several hours to get approved to
    login to the site; even though I had access to the administrator page.
    (DoS attacks?)

	TONY: This the ASU SMTP server's fault. Over the testing period 173
	emails were sent. It's likely there was a backlog. As far as the app
	goes the emails were sent immediately after a new user request was
	made.

  * Action: Create non unique username Result: Information leakage, able to
    see which usernames are currently taken

  * There is no password recovery used in this website. It is not a
    vulnerability but is a design flaw by which a user cannot recover the
    password and will create another account and this results in
    unnecessary flooding the database. This will result in multiple
    accounts for the same user.

	TONY: This was a design choice, passwords can be reset thought the
	rails console by an administrator on the server itself. Having a
	"forgot password" feature can open a lot of vulnerabilities.

  * Human verification is not done. Any computer can be used to register
    the users.  A challenge- response scheme such as CAPTCHA should have
    been used in order to ensure that the users have not been generated by
    a computer.
